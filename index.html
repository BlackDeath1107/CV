    <p>I am a sophomore pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering from Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. I love meeting new people, accepting new challenges and gaining experience in new fields. I am keen to learn new things and am open to change. 
         I led a team of 20 members in a competition called Diversion based on web development and created our website Sorteria, which eventually won the first prize in the beginner's category.
         I am in the practise of enhancing my Digital Art and Graphic Designing skills , having previously graduated with a degree in art and drawing upto 1st year with an impressive First Division.
         I am very eloquent in public speaking and elocution having won numerous prizes at intra-school, inter-school and state level, including bagging the prestigious Jugal Srinmal Scholarship award twice in a row.
         I have been an avid reader from my early childhood and content writing and creative writing has always been my area of interest.
         As a member of the IEDC of my college, I have been a part of multiple innovative projects and have designed products such as a wifi repeater, a motion sensing house system and many more.
         I am very interested in AI and proficient in C, Java, and DSA.
